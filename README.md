##DO NOT USE THE WEB SCRAPING IRRESPONSIBLY. For it can overload the system.
###This project aims to make available a statistical analysis of public healthcare data from DataSUS. Though the data scraped is public, refrain from excessively executing scraping scripts in order to prevent damages/lag/performance to the system. I only scraped the data in order to gather it. Once that was done, every query was executed from a distinct database.

###There will be many more updates, including more data. I won't make available the other scraping tools that will be used to gather the data so as to DataSUS's web system
